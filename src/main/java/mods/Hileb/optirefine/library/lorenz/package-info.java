/**
 * Lorenz is a library built to interact with Java de-obfuscation mappings.
 *
 * <p>This library gives developers a way to express de-obfuscation mappings, in
 * addition to performing IO for a variety of formats (users can also write
 * their own readers and writers).</p>
 *
 * <p>I developed Lorenz specifically for my needs, largely around Minecraft, and
 * so I have implemented IO classes for the following formats:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>SRG</li>
 *     <li>CSRG</li>
 *     <li>TSRG</li>
 *     <li>XSRG</li>
 * </ul>
