/**
 * <p>
 * A service for merging mappings. The result of a mapping merge is a new mapping which contains the result you would
 * expect to get after using the two mappings being merged in order, left, then right.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Put another way, merging 2 mappings means the deobfuscated output of the left {@link MappingSet} and the obfuscated
 * input of the right {@link MappingSet} match, creating a single {@link MappingSet} with the obfuscated input of the
 * left side and the deobfuscated output of the right side.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * More complex situations are likely to occur while merging mappings, so this table will go through the different
 * possible cases and how a mapping set merger handles them in the default implementation:
 * </p>
 * <table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid; width: 100%;">

 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;">{@code A -> B}</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;"><i>Missing</i></td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 19%;">{@code A -> B}</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 45%;">Standalone mappings get copied</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;"><i>Missing</i></td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;">{@code B -> C}</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 19%;">{@code B -> C}</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 45%;">Standalone mappings get copied</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;">{@code A -> B}</td>

 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 45%;">
 *             This is no different than the 2 above cases with missing mappings on each side. This is just meant to be
 *             a further example that if two unrelated mappings are present, a standard merger won't know how to handle
 *             them other than copying both.
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid;">

 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 19%;">{@code A -> C}</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 45%;">
 *             By default the right mapping is considered the "most up to date" mappings, so in the case where both
 *             mapping sets provide mappings for the same obfuscated name, the right mapping is used in the default
 *             implementation.
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;">{@code A -> B}<br>(types and names)</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 18%;">{@code B -> B} (types)<br>{@code A -> C} (names)</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 19%;">{@code A -> B} (types)<br>{@code A -> C} (names)</td>
 *         <td style="padding: 8px; width: 45%;">
 *             This is an example of a special case situation where the left mapping only maps types, then the second
 *             mapping set only maps members, but from the expectation that the first mapping set was already applied.
 *             The default implementation should handle this case correctly.
 *         </td>
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * All of these cases can happen in a single mapping merge. That is to say, some cases may apply to some classes and
 * methods but not others, but all during a single merge. It's important to note that it's illegal to merge a
 * {@code null} mapping set with another set, both must exist. The <i>Missing</i> cases in the table refer to situations
 * where one mapping set contains entries the other doesn't.
 * </p>
 *
 * @apiNote This class was added after the {@link MappingSet#merge} and related methods were implemented. The merge
 *          methods are equivalent to this class, as they only call back to the default implementation of this class.
 * @implNote The default implementation of this interface uses a {@link MappingSetMergerHandler} to handle each specific
 *           merging situation. To modify specific instances of merging behavior, it may be simpler to override that
 *           class instead and only modify the specific type of merge you want to change.
