/**
 * <p>
 * This class represents the result of a mapping merge handled by a {@link MappingSetMergerHandler}. This
 * class is only relevant to mapping types which have children, which includes both top level and inner class mappings,
 * and method mappings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class holds 2 values:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The merge result</li>
 *     <li>The child mappings on the right to merge into the merge result with the left side of the merge</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * When a merge occurs with mappings which contain child data the merger will need to recurse into the child data and
 * merge those mappings too. Depending on the situation this may not be desirable, or you may wish to control
 * specifically which mappings do or don't get merged. Typically there will only be one mapping on the right side, but
 * some situations, such as duplicates and method mappings, may have multiple mappings that you may want merged. By
 * storing those mappings in a list in that class that allows the merger to have the most flexibility in choosing which
 * mappings are or aren't merged.
 * </p>
 *
 * @apiNote This class should only contains the mappings on the <b>right side</b> of the merge which should be mapped.
 *          The left side is considered the source and is always mapped.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the result of the merge handler.
